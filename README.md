# EggServer

Create projects with a lower attack risk

### basics
EggServer encodes your files before serving them, so you don't have to worry about obfuscation, and have more time for doing what really matters.<br><br>
EggServer wraps your files in a script that is set to unpack the base64 encoded version of your file (only HTML, can be configured) and display it normally. When inspecting, people would see a single script tag along with a large string of incomprehensable javascript.
